## Introduction
## Mini Snake Gameüêç
   The history of the Snake game goes back to the 1970's. However, it was the 1980's when the game took on the look that we will be using. It was sold under numerous names and many platforms but probably gained widespread recognition when it was shipped as standard on Nokia mobile phones in the late 1990's.
 It is compiled in Code::blocks using the gcc compiler. The code is about 550 lines; so I haven‚Äôt displayed the source code here.
 
 In this project, you can play the popular ‚ÄúSnake Game‚Äù just like you played it elsewhere. You have to use the up, down, right or left arrows to move the snake.
Foods are provided at the several co-ordinates of the screen for the snake to eat. Every time the snake eats the food, its length will by increased by one element along with the score.
## Research

Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 two-player arcade game Blockade from Gremlin Industries, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. 1982's Tron arcade game, based on the movie, includes Snake gameplay for the single-player Light Cycles segment, cementing a connection between the two.

## Features
-The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, 
it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games,
the end of the trail is in a fixed position, 
so the snake continually gets longer as it moves.

  -Snake is a classic game that requires players to assess their surroundings and find the quickest or safest route to a point. This is an excellent opportunity to learn about spatial awareness and plan ahead to your next move.

   -Snake game is a computer action game, whose goal is to control a snake to move and In our future work,
   -Snake is a tool that can be used as an educational helping hand. One of the important parts of learning is that you will never get something right the first time. Snake teaches children that practice makes perfect when it comes to learning new skills. 
 # Weakness
 -The classic game is infamous for using your own success against you when you become so long that you get in your own way. Whilst many games and activities can teach your child about vital life skills, there are not many that would educate on long term strategic planning.
